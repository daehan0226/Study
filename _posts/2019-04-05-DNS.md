### What is DNS?
- The Domain Name Systems (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. 
- Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. 
- Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 
- **DNS translates *domain names to IP addresses* so browsers can load Internet resources.**

- Each device connected to the Internet has a **unique IP address** which other machines **use to find the device**. 
- DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

### How does DNS work?
- The process of DNS resolution involves **converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1)**. 
- An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that **IP address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device**  like a street address is used to find a particular home. 
- When **a user wants to load a webpage**, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser **(example.com)-HOSTNAME** and **the machine-friendly address-IP** necessary to locate the example.com webpage.

- In order to understand the process behind the DNS resolution, it’s important to learn about the different hardware components a DNS query must pass between. For the web browser, the DNS lookup occurs “ behind the scenes” and requires no interaction from the user’s computer apart from the initial request.
